### What is a Merchant of Record?

As a Merchant of Record, we take on responsibility for global sales taxes on your behalf.
So you can focus on growing your business instead of dealing with accounting invoices. Leave billing infrastructure, payments, and the headaches of international taxes to us.

### Payment Service Providers (PSPs) vs. Merchants of Record

**Payment Service Providers (PSPs)**

PSPs like Stripe provide an accessible, convenient abstraction to facilitate transactions over the underlying card networks and banks.

* ✅ Powerful, flexible, low-level APIs for facilitating transactions
* ✅ Can be used to power all business models and pricing under the sun
* ❌ You are responsible for all tasks associated with transactions, e.g., international taxes, refunds, disputes
* ❌ The APIs require more development and greater complexity even for common use cases

**Merchants of Record (MoRs)**

Merchants of Record provide an abstraction layer to facilitate digital transactions.

* ✅ High-level dashboard, APIs, and SDKs to make payment infrastructure easy to use
* ✅ The platform handles international sales taxes by acting as a reseller of your digital goods and services
* ✅ Integrates other tasks like refunds, disputes, and pricing changes into a single platform
* ❌ Higher fees per payment

### What should you choose?

**Build and go to market with what you’re comfortable with**

As in programming, abstractions are super useful to ship faster with fewer worries. So, what’s the ideal level of abstraction for you? Well, it depends.

**Choose Stripe (PSP) if...**

* Already integrated it? If you’re already in production — we’re devs, just keep shipping
* You’re already comfortable with Stripe’s API
* You want to handle all your event and subscription logic in-house
* You’re comfortable handling international taxes yourself

**Choose Commet (MoR) if...**

* You want product, customer, pricing, and subscription management through an intuitive tool your whole team can use
* You want to focus on building product and go live today
* You don’t even want to think about handling international taxes and tax registrations yourself
* You’re looking for a simple, developer-focused solution

### Our Vision: The Future of Tech Companies

**We firmly believe the unicorns of the future will be startups with teams of 5 to 30 people.**

In a world where technology enables small teams to build incredible products, monetization complexity shouldn’t be a barrier. Small teams need simple, powerful, developer-focused tools that let them:

* Focus on building their product, not payment infrastructure
* Scale globally from day one
* Handle tax compliance without massive legal teams
* Iterate quickly on monetization models

**Commet exists to be the simplest, developer‑preferred tool for monetization.**

We don’t aim to be the solution for every use case. But we want to be the tool small teams choose when they want to monetize simply, globally, and without hassle.
