# Business logic & design

This page connects the strategy behind the Product Catalog to the systems that execute it. Use it when you need to translate commercial ideas into catalog configuration or when you must explain pricing logic to stakeholders.

<Callout type="info">
Platform documentation aims at business operators. For SDKs, endpoints, and code samples head to the Developer Library.

## Why the catalog exists

The catalog solves pricing-complexity management for billing platforms that juggle multiple pricing models and customer-specific terms.

**Problems it eliminates**

- Custom code for every new price or promotion.
- Sales asking “What’s the official price?” vs. “What are we offering this customer?”
- Lack of analytics on discount adoption or premium pricing.
- No approval workflow for large enterprise concessions.
- Pricing updates blocked behind engineering queues.

**Business outcomes**

- Clear list price vs. customer price conversations.
- Accurate analytics for margins, discounts, and product performance.
- Negotiation playbooks that combine list tiers and approved variants.
- Automated governance that flags discounts beyond policy.
- Freedom to support any business model without code changes.

## Four pricing layers working together

```
Products describe the services you sell:
├── API Platform → API access with rate limiting
├── Analytics Dashboard → Reporting and insights
├── Premium Support → 24/7 help with SLA
├── Data Storage → Scalable storage
└── AI Processing → Machine learning services
```

```
Product: API Platform
├── List Price: Starter → $50/month, 10K calls included
├── List Price: Professional → $200/month, 100K calls included
├── List Price: Enterprise → $500/month, 1M calls included
└── List Price: Pay-per-use → $0.10 per call, no minimum
```

```
List Price: Enterprise ($500/month)
├── Price Variant: Acme Corp → 20% discount = $400/month
├── Price Variant: MercadoLibre → $500/month, 2M calls included
├── Price Variant: Startup Beta → 50% discount = $250/month
└── Price Variant: Enterprise Plus → 10% markup = $550/month
```

```
Agreement: Acme Corp – Q1 2025
├── Item 1: API Platform → Enterprise Plan (20% variant)
├── Item 2: Analytics Dashboard → Professional Plan (list price)
├── Item 3: Premium Support → Custom price variant
└── Contract discount: 5% promo for Q1
```

Each layer keeps analytics intact and separates permanent configuration (variants) from temporary negotiation tools (agreement discounts).

## Real-world catalogs

<Tabs items={['SaaS Ladder', 'Payments', 'AI & ML']}>
<Tab value="SaaS Ladder">
**Company**: DevTools Inc. – API development platform

1. Start with Free → Starter → Pro → Enterprise list prices.
2. Add-ons such as Analytics or Priority Support live as separate products.
3. Enterprise deals add price variants (20% off, extra seats).
4. The agreement bundles everything so billing can generate accurate invoices.
</Tab>
<Tab value="Payments">
**Company**: PayFlow – payment processor

- List prices capture standard, volume, and enterprise transaction fees.
- Price variants store negotiated percentage rates and minimum commitments.
- Additional products cover cross-border fees and chargeback insurance.
- Agreements combine multi-product bundles with volume-based approvals.
</Tab>
<Tab value="AI & ML">
**Company**: AIFlow – machine learning platform

- Products: compute hours, data scientist seats, model hosting.
- List prices mix on-demand, reserved, and spot usage offers.
- Variants track high-volume seat discounts and custom GPU bundles.
- Agreements apply temporary promos while variants manage long-term terms.
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Supported pricing models

| Model | Use case | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Fixed / subscription** | Predictable revenue, monthly or one-time fees. | $500/month platform fee, $2,500 onboarding |
| **Linear usage** | Pay-per-use with included units. | $0.10 per API call after 1,000 free calls |
| **Percentage-based** | Payments or revenue-sharing with safeguards. | 2.9% of transaction value with $0.30 min / $10 max |
| **Volume tiers** | Customer pays the rate of the tier they land in. | 0–100 units @ $1 + $20 flat, 101+ @ $0.75 + $50 |
| **Graduated tiers** | Progressive pricing like tax brackets. | First 100 GB @ $1, remaining @ $0.75 |
| **Packaged / stair-step** | Sell bundles of units. | $10 per 250 SMS sent |
| **Seat-based** | Billing tied to seat balances. | $50 per admin seat per month |
| **Minimum fees** | Guarantee baseline revenue. | $500 monthly minimum applied across usage prices |
| **Credit burndown** | Prepaid credits with rollover. | 2,500 credits pack, 10 credits per API call |

Code-friendly examples live in the developer docs, but the catalog UI exposes each model as configurable options.

## Governance rules

**When to create a product**

1. New value proposition or service line.
2. Different tax treatment.
3. Separate reporting needs.

**When to publish a list price**

1. New segment or market positioning.
2. Different commitment period or included units.
3. Switching pricing models (fixed vs. usage vs. tiers).

**When to use a price variant**

1. Customer-specific discount or currency.
2. Contracted unit changes or volume commitments.
3. Long-lived custom terms (not temporary promos).

**When to apply agreement discounts**

- Ramp-up phases, quarter promotions, or limited-time incentives.
- Layered on top of list prices and variants without breaking analytics.

## Multi-tenant flexibility

Each organization running on Commet can configure its own catalog:

- **Startup catalog**: a single core product with 4 plans, a couple of add-ons, minimal variants.
- **Enterprise catalog**: multiple products, professional services, dozens of variants with approvals, aggressive discount policies.

The catalog supports both extremes on the same infrastructure, keeping segmentation, discount policies, and reporting separate.

## Billing engine integration

All billing internals live in `billing-engine.md`, but here’s the high-level handshake:

- Products provide tax categories and descriptions for invoices.
- List prices act as the official baseline for negotiations.
- Price variants inject permanent customer customization.
- Pricing models (fixed, usage, seats, tiers) feed the billing calculator.
- Agreements combine everything and pass it downstream for invoice generation.

```typescript
function resolveFinalPricing(agreementItem: AgreementItem) {
  const listPrice = getListPrice(agreementItem.listPriceId);
  let finalAmount = listPrice.unitAmount;

  if (agreementItem.priceVariantId) {
    const variant = getPriceVariant(agreementItem.priceVariantId);
    finalAmount = applyVariantPricing(finalAmount, variant);
  }

  if (agreementItem.agreementDiscountType) {
    finalAmount = applyAgreementDiscount(finalAmount, agreementItem);
  }

  return { listPrice, finalAmount };
}
```

## Integration points with other modules

- **Usage module**: `price_variant.usage_metric_id → usage_metric.id` to track consumption.
- **Seats module**: `agreement_item.quantity_source = 'seat_balance'` pulls seat counts automatically.
- **Tax module**: `product.tax_category_id → tax_category.id` applies correct rates per product.
- **Customer module**: optional `price_variant.customer_id` to tie custom pricing to a specific account.

## End-to-end workflow

1. **Catalog setup**: define the product portfolio and assign tax categories.
2. **List price design**: product marketing publishes official pricing for each segment.
3. **Negotiation**: sales crafts price variants with approvals for custom deals.
4. **Contract signing**: agreements reference list prices, variants, and temporary discounts.
5. **Billing automation**: the billing engine executes the cascade and produces transparent receipts.

## Key success metrics

- Zero pricing errors in invoices.
- Full pricing-model coverage without engineering involvement.
- Sub-two-second pricing calculations even with complex tiers.
- No manual adjustments due to catalog limitations.

## Troubleshooting common scenarios

| Scenario | Root cause | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Invoice shows wrong price | Variant or agreement discount not applied | Verify `agreement_item` links correct `price_variant_id` and discount settings |
| Tax calculation missing | Product missing `tax_category_id` | Assign tax category to product before creating list prices |
| Pricing resolution timeout | Complex tier calculations with many variants | Optimize tier structure or cache frequently-used pricing paths |
| Discount approval bypassed | No policy enforcement on variant creation | Enable approval workflows in RevOps settings |
