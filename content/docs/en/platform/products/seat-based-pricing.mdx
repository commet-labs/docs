## Why seat-based pricing

Seat-based pricing creates predictable revenue while aligning costs with customer team growth. As teams expand, revenue grows proportionally, making it one of the most popular SaaS pricing models.

**Problems it solves:**

- Unpredictable revenue from usage-only models
- Complex capacity planning for unlimited user access
- Difficulty pricing multi-user products fairly
- Tracking who's using your product and how much
- Managing enterprise contracts with minimum commitments

**Business outcomes:**

- Predictable monthly recurring revenue (MRR)
- Revenue scales automatically with customer growth
- Clear pricing that's easy to understand and forecast
- Flexible seat management with minimums and overages
- Enterprise-ready with tiered volume discounts

## How seat-based pricing works

│                 │  + prorated additions if mid-cycle
└─────────────────┘
```

### 1. Define seat types

Create different seat types for various user roles:

```typescript
// Example: Different seat types by role
{
  id: "admin-seat-uuid",
  name: "Admin Seat",
  key: "admin_seat",
  description: "Full platform access with admin privileges"
}

{
  id: "editor-seat-uuid",
  name: "Editor Seat",
  key: "editor_seat",
  description: "Content creation and editing access"
}

{
  id: "viewer-seat-uuid",
  name: "Viewer Seat",
  key: "viewer_seat",
  description: "Read-only access"
}
```

### 2. Configure seat pricing

Set up pricing for each seat type:

```typescript
// Linear pricing: $50 per admin seat
{
  pricingModel: "per_unit",
  unitAmount: 5000,         // $50 per seat
  currency: "USD",
  billingInterval: "monthly",
  billInAdvance: false,     // Arrears (charge at end)
  quantitySource: "seat_balance",
  seatTypeId: "admin-seat-uuid"
}
```

### 3. Automatic seat tracking

Commet tracks seat changes in real-time:

- **Seat additions**: Automatically prorated for mid-cycle adds
- **Seat removals**: Applied at next billing cycle or immediately
- **Seat balance**: Current count of active seats per type
- **History**: Audit trail of all seat changes

### 4. Billing automation

Invoices are generated automatically:

```
Admin Seats
20 seats × $50.00 = $1,000.00

Editor Seats
5 seats × $30.00 = $150.00

Total: $1,150.00
```

## Seat-based pricing models

<Tabs items={['Linear', 'Graduated Tiers', 'With Minimums']}>
<Tab value="Linear">
**Linear seat-based pricing**

Same price per seat regardless of quantity. Simple and predictable.

```typescript
{
  pricingModel: "per_unit",
  unitAmount: 5000,         // $50 per seat
  currency: "USD",
  billingInterval: "monthly",
  billInAdvance: false,     // Arrears
  quantitySource: "seat_balance",
  seatTypeId: "standard-seat-uuid"
}

// 20 seats × $50 = $1,000
// 100 seats × $50 = $5,000
```

**Real-world examples:**
- **Figma**: $15/editor/month (flat rate)
- **Notion**: $10/user/month (flat rate for Plus)
- **Linear**: $8/user/month (flat rate)

**When to use:**
- Simple, transparent pricing needed
- No volume discount strategy
- Small to medium team sizes (< 50 users)
- Want to keep pricing straightforward
</Tab>

<Tab value="Graduated Tiers">
**Graduated seat-based pricing**

Price per seat decreases as quantity increases, rewarding larger teams.

```typescript
{
  pricingModel: "tiered",
  tierType: "graduated",
  quantitySource: "seat_balance",
  seatTypeId: "enterprise-seat-uuid"
}

// Tiers configured separately
price_variant_tier: [
  {
    tierOrder: 1,
    upTo: 15,
    unitAmount: 5000,       // First 15 seats @ $50
    flatFee: 0
  },
  {
    tierOrder: 2,
    upTo: 50,
    unitAmount: 4000,       // Next 35 seats @ $40
    flatFee: 0
  },
  {
    tierOrder: 3,
    upTo: null,             // 50+ seats
    unitAmount: 3000,       // @ $30
    flatFee: 0
  }
]
```

**Calculation example for 60 seats:**
```
Tier 1: 15 seats × $50 = $750
Tier 2: 35 seats × $40 = $1,400
Tier 3: 10 seats × $30 = $300
────────────────────────────
Total: $2,450/month
```

**Real-world examples:**
- **Slack**: Volume discounts for larger teams
- **GitHub**: Enterprise pricing scales with seats
- **Salesforce**: Progressive per-user pricing

**When to use:**
- Targeting enterprise customers
- Want to incentivize team growth
- Competitive in large team market
- Need volume discount strategy
</Tab>

<Tab value="With Minimums">
**Seat pricing with contracted minimums**

Guarantee minimum seats billed, charge for overages.

```typescript
// Agreement configuration
{
  minimumSeats: 50,         // Contracted minimum
  actualSeats: 45,          // Current usage
  billedSeats: 50           // Bill for minimum
}

// Next month if seats grow
{
  minimumSeats: 50,
  actualSeats: 65,          // Grew beyond minimum
  billedSeats: 65           // Bill for actual (overage)
}
```

**How it works:**

| Scenario | Minimum | Actual | Billed | Calculation |
|----------|---------|--------|--------|-------------|
| Under minimum | 50 | 35 | 50 | 50 × $50 = $2,500 |
| At minimum | 50 | 50 | 50 | 50 × $50 = $2,500 |
| Over minimum | 50 | 75 | 75 | 75 × $50 = $3,750 |

**Real-world examples:**
- **Enterprise contracts**: "Minimum 100 seats commitment"
- **Annual deals**: Guaranteed minimums for discount
- **Volume agreements**: "Minimum $10K/month spend"

**When to use:**
- Enterprise sales contracts
- Annual commitments with discounts
- Guaranteed revenue minimums
- Protect against seat fluctuation
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Billing timing: Advance vs Arrears

### Arrears billing (charge at end)

Charge for seats used during the **previous** billing period.

```typescript
{
  billInAdvance: false      // Arrears
}
```

**How it works:**
1. March 1-31: Customer uses 20 seats
2. April 1: Invoice generated for March usage
3. Customer billed: 20 × $50 = $1,000

**Advantages:**
- Charge for actual usage
- Fair for customers adding/removing seats
- No refunds needed for seat removals
- Easier to explain "you pay for what you used"

**Use cases:**
- Monthly seat fluctuations expected
- Trial/onboarding periods
- Startups with changing team sizes

### Advance billing (charge upfront)

Charge for seats for the **upcoming** billing period.

```typescript
{
  billInAdvance: true       // Advance
}
```

**How it works:**
1. March 1: Invoice for March 1-31 usage
2. Customer pre-pays: 20 × $50 = $1,000
3. March 1-31: Customer uses the pre-paid seats

**Advantages:**
- Predictable cash flow
- Revenue recognized upfront
- Reduces churn (prepaid = commitment)
- Standard SaaS practice

**Use cases:**
- Stable enterprise teams
- Annual contracts
- SaaS standard practice
- Need cash flow predictability

## Proration for mid-cycle changes

### Adding seats mid-cycle

When seats are added during a billing period, customers are charged a prorated amount.

**Example: Monthly billing, arrears**
```
Billing period: March 1-31 (31 days)
Starting seats: 10 @ $50/seat

March 15: Add 5 seats (17 days remaining)

Calculation:
- Original 10 seats: 31 days × $50 = $500
- New 5 seats: 17/31 days × $50 × 5 = $137.10
- Total March invoice: $637.10
```

**Proration formula:**
```typescript
proratedAmount = (daysRemaining / totalDays) × seatPrice × seatsAdded
```

### Removing seats mid-cycle

**Arrears billing**: No proration needed (billed at end for actual usage)

**Advance billing**: Credit applied to next invoice or refunded

## Common seat-based pricing strategies

### Strategy 1: Role-based seat pricing

Different prices for different user types.

```typescript
// Admin seats: Full access
{
  seatTypeId: "admin-seat",
  unitAmount: 10000        // $100/seat
}

// Editor seats: Content access
{
  seatTypeId: "editor-seat",
  unitAmount: 5000         // $50/seat
}

// Viewer seats: Read-only
{
  seatTypeId: "viewer-seat",
  unitAmount: 1000         // $10/seat
}
```

**Real-world examples:**
- **Figma**: Editors ($15) vs Viewers (free)
- **Miro**: Full members vs Guests
- **Notion**: Members vs Guests pricing

**When to use:**
- Clear value difference between roles
- Want to monetize all user types
- Encourage wider adoption with cheap viewers
- Complex permission systems

### Strategy 2: Hybrid seat + usage

Combine seat-based baseline with usage overages.

```typescript
// Base: Seat pricing
{
  seatTypeId: "developer-seat",
  unitAmount: 5000,        // $50/seat
  includedUsage: 10000     // 10K API calls included per seat
}

// Overage: Usage pricing
{
  pricingModel: "per_unit",
  unitAmount: 100,         // $0.01/call for overages
  usageMetricId: "api-calls"
}
```

**Example billing:**
```
10 Developer Seats × $50 = $500/month
Included: 100K API calls (10K per seat)

Actual usage: 150K calls
Overage: 50K × $0.01 = $500

Total: $500 (seats) + $500 (overage) = $1,000
```

**When to use:**
- Usage varies significantly per user
- Want predictable base + flexible ceiling
- Avoid bill shock from pure usage pricing
- Common in API platforms, infrastructure

### Strategy 3: Tiered plans with seat limits

Fixed plans with included seat ranges.

```
Starter Plan: $99/month
├── Up to 5 seats included
└── $20 per additional seat

Professional Plan: $299/month
├── Up to 20 seats included
└── $15 per additional seat

Enterprise Plan: Custom pricing
├── Unlimited seats
└── Volume discounts available
```

**When to use:**
- Want simple plan tiers
- Packaging strategy (good-better-best)
- Small teams prefer all-inclusive pricing
- Reduce pricing complexity

## Seat management best practices

### Tracking seat usage

**Automatic sync from your app:**
```typescript
// Add seat
await commet.seats.add({
  customerId: "customer-uuid",
  seatTypeId: "admin-seat-uuid",
  userId: "user-123",
  email: "john@acme.com",
  effectiveDate: new Date()
});

// Remove seat
await commet.seats.remove({
  customerId: "customer-uuid",
  seatId: "seat-uuid",
  effectiveDate: new Date()  // or future date
});

// Get current balance
const balance = await commet.seats.getBalance({
  customerId: "customer-uuid",
  seatTypeId: "admin-seat-uuid"
});
// Returns: { quantity: 20, lastUpdated: "2025-01-15" }
```

### Customer transparency

**Real-time seat dashboards:**
- Show current seat count vs contracted minimum
- Display cost per seat and total monthly cost
- Preview impact of adding/removing seats
- Show proration calculations before confirming

**Seat usage alerts:**
- Notify when approaching contracted minimum
- Alert when adding seats mid-cycle (proration warning)
- Remind before billing cycle for seat optimization

### Governance and controls

**Seat limits:**
```typescript
{
  minimumSeats: 10,        // Contract minimum
  maximumSeats: 100,       // Hard cap (optional)
  currentSeats: 45,        // Actual usage
  allowOverages: true      // Can exceed minimum
}
```

**Approval workflows:**
- Require admin approval for seat additions
- Finance approval for overages beyond threshold
- Automatic notifications for seat changes

## Troubleshooting seat-based billing

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Seats not appearing on invoice | Seat added after period close | Ensure seats added before billing cycle ends |
| Proration incorrect | Wrong effective date | Verify seat addition date is accurate |
| Billed for removed seats | Seats not removed in system | Audit seat balance vs active users |
| Customer disputes seat count | Mismatch between app and billing | Implement daily seat sync reconciliation |
| Minimum not enforced | Agreement configuration missing | Check agreement has minimumSeats set |
| Overage charges unexpected | Customer unaware of minimums | Display seat limits in customer dashboard |
