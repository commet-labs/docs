# Seat-Based Pricing

Seat-based pricing allows you to charge customers based on the number of users, seats, or licenses they have active in their account. This model is perfect for team collaboration tools, SaaS platforms, and enterprise software where value scales with team size.

## Why seat-based pricing

Seat-based pricing creates predictable revenue while aligning costs with customer team growth. As teams expand, revenue grows proportionally, making it one of the most popular SaaS pricing models.

**Problems it solves:**

- Unpredictable revenue from usage-only models
- Complex capacity planning for unlimited user access
- Difficulty pricing multi-user products fairly
- Tracking who's using your product and how much
- Managing enterprise contracts with minimum commitments

**Business outcomes:**

- Predictable monthly recurring revenue (MRR)
- Revenue scales automatically with customer growth
- Clear pricing that's easy to understand and forecast
- Flexible seat management with minimums and overages
- Enterprise-ready with tiered volume discounts

## How seat-based pricing works

│                 │  + prorated additions if mid-cycle
└─────────────────┘
```

### 1. Define seat types

Create different seat types for various user roles:

```typescript
// Example: Different seat types by role
{
  id: "admin-seat-uuid",
  name: "Admin Seat",
  key: "admin_seat",
  description: "Full platform access with admin privileges"
}

{
  id: "editor-seat-uuid",
  name: "Editor Seat",
  key: "editor_seat",
  description: "Content creation and editing access"
}

{
  id: "viewer-seat-uuid",
  name: "Viewer Seat",
  key: "viewer_seat",
  description: "Read-only access"
}
```

### 2. Configure seat pricing

Set up pricing for each seat type:

```typescript
// Linear pricing: $50 per admin seat
{
  pricingModel: "per_unit",
  unitAmount: 5000,         // $50 per seat
  currency: "USD",
  billingInterval: "monthly",
  billInAdvance: false,     // Arrears (charge at end)
  quantitySource: "seat_balance",
  seatTypeId: "admin-seat-uuid"
}
```

### 3. Automatic seat tracking

Commet tracks seat changes in real-time:

- **Seat additions**: Automatically prorated for mid-cycle adds
- **Seat removals**: Applied at next billing cycle or immediately
- **Seat balance**: Current count of active seats per type
- **History**: Audit trail of all seat changes

### 4. Billing automation

Invoices are generated automatically:

```
Admin Seats
20 seats × $50.00 = $1,000.00

Editor Seats
5 seats × $30.00 = $150.00

Total: $1,150.00
```

## Seat-based pricing models

<Tabs items={['Linear', 'Graduated Tiers', 'With Minimums']}>
<Tab value="Linear">
**Linear seat-based pricing**

Same price per seat regardless of quantity. Simple and predictable.

```typescript
{
  pricingModel: "per_unit",
  unitAmount: 5000,         // $50 per seat
  currency: "USD",
  billingInterval: "monthly",
  billInAdvance: false,     // Arrears
  quantitySource: "seat_balance",
  seatTypeId: "standard-seat-uuid"
}

// 20 seats × $50 = $1,000
// 100 seats × $50 = $5,000
```

**Real-world examples:**
- **Figma**: $15/editor/month (flat rate)
- **Notion**: $10/user/month (flat rate for Plus)
- **Linear**: $8/user/month (flat rate)

**When to use:**
- Simple, transparent pricing needed
- No volume discount strategy
- Small to medium team sizes (< 50 users)
- Want to keep pricing straightforward
</Tab>

<Tab value="Graduated Tiers">
**Graduated seat-based pricing**

Price per seat decreases as quantity increases, rewarding larger teams.

```typescript
{
  pricingModel: "tiered",
  tierType: "graduated",
  quantitySource: "seat_balance",
  seatTypeId: "enterprise-seat-uuid"
}

// Tiers configured separately
price_variant_tier: [
  {
    tierOrder: 1,
    upTo: 15,
    unitAmount: 5000,       // First 15 seats @ $50
    flatFee: 0
  },
  {
    tierOrder: 2,
    upTo: 50,
    unitAmount: 4000,       // Next 35 seats @ $40
    flatFee: 0
  },
  {
    tierOrder: 3,
    upTo: null,             // 50+ seats
    unitAmount: 3000,       // @ $30
    flatFee: 0
  }
]
```

**Calculation example for 60 seats:**
```
Tier 1: 15 seats × $50 = $750
Tier 2: 35 seats × $40 = $1,400
Tier 3: 10 seats × $30 = $300
────────────────────────────
Total: $2,450/month
```

**Real-world examples:**
- **Slack**: Volume discounts for larger teams
- **GitHub**: Enterprise pricing scales with seats
- **Salesforce**: Progressive per-user pricing

**When to use:**
- Targeting enterprise customers
- Want to incentivize team growth
- Competitive in large team market
- Need volume discount strategy
</Tab>

<Tab value="With Minimums">
**Seat pricing with contracted minimums**

Guarantee minimum seats billed, charge for overages.

```typescript
// Agreement configuration
{
  minimumSeats: 50,         // Contracted minimum
  actualSeats: 45,          // Current usage
  billedSeats: 50           // Bill for minimum
}

// Next month if seats grow
{
  minimumSeats: 50,
  actualSeats: 65,          // Grew beyond minimum
  billedSeats: 65           // Bill for actual (overage)
}
```

**How it works:**

| Scenario | Minimum | Actual | Billed | Calculation |
|----------|---------|--------|--------|-------------|
| Under minimum | 50 | 35 | 50 | 50 × $50 = $2,500 |
| At minimum | 50 | 50 | 50 | 50 × $50 = $2,500 |
| Over minimum | 50 | 75 | 75 | 75 × $50 = $3,750 |

**Real-world examples:**
- **Enterprise contracts**: "Minimum 100 seats commitment"
- **Annual deals**: Guaranteed minimums for discount
- **Volume agreements**: "Minimum $10K/month spend"

**When to use:**
- Enterprise sales contracts
- Annual commitments with discounts
- Guaranteed revenue minimums
- Protect against seat fluctuation
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Billing timing: Advance vs Arrears

### Arrears billing (charge at end)

Charge for seats used during the **previous** billing period.

```typescript
{
  billInAdvance: false      // Arrears
}
```

**How it works:**
1. March 1-31: Customer uses 20 seats
2. April 1: Invoice generated for March usage
3. Customer billed: 20 × $50 = $1,000

**Advantages:**
- Charge for actual usage
- Fair for customers adding/removing seats
- No refunds needed for seat removals
- Easier to explain "you pay for what you used"

**Use cases:**
- Monthly seat fluctuations expected
- Trial/onboarding periods
- Startups with changing team sizes

### Advance billing (charge upfront)

Charge for seats for the **upcoming** billing period.

```typescript
{
  billInAdvance: true       // Advance
}
```

**How it works:**
1. March 1: Invoice for March 1-31 usage
2. Customer pre-pays: 20 × $50 = $1,000
3. March 1-31: Customer uses the pre-paid seats

**Advantages:**
- Predictable cash flow
- Revenue recognized upfront
- Reduces churn (prepaid = commitment)
- Standard SaaS practice

**Use cases:**
- Stable enterprise teams
- Annual contracts
- SaaS standard practice
- Need cash flow predictability

## Proration for mid-cycle changes

### Adding seats mid-cycle

When seats are added during a billing period, customers are charged a prorated amount.

**Example: Monthly billing, arrears**
```
Billing period: March 1-31 (31 days)
Starting seats: 10 @ $50/seat

March 15: Add 5 seats (17 days remaining)

Calculation:
- Original 10 seats: 31 days × $50 = $500
- New 5 seats: 17/31 days × $50 × 5 = $137.10
- Total March invoice: $637.10
```

**Proration formula:**
```typescript
proratedAmount = (daysRemaining / totalDays) × seatPrice × seatsAdded
```

### Removing seats mid-cycle

**Arrears billing**: No proration needed (billed at end for actual usage)

**Advance billing**: Credit applied to next invoice or refunded

## Common seat-based pricing strategies

### Strategy 1: Role-based seat pricing

Different prices for different user types.

```typescript
// Admin seats: Full access
{
  seatTypeId: "admin-seat",
  unitAmount: 10000        // $100/seat
}

// Editor seats: Content access
{
  seatTypeId: "editor-seat",
  unitAmount: 5000         // $50/seat
}

// Viewer seats: Read-only
{
  seatTypeId: "viewer-seat",
  unitAmount: 1000         // $10/seat
}
```

**Real-world examples:**
- **Figma**: Editors ($15) vs Viewers (free)
- **Miro**: Full members vs Guests
- **Notion**: Members vs Guests pricing

**When to use:**
- Clear value difference between roles
- Want to monetize all user types
- Encourage wider adoption with cheap viewers
- Complex permission systems

### Strategy 2: Hybrid seat + usage

Combine seat-based baseline with usage overages.

```typescript
// Base: Seat pricing
{
  seatTypeId: "developer-seat",
  unitAmount: 5000,        // $50/seat
  includedUsage: 10000     // 10K API calls included per seat
}

// Overage: Usage pricing
{
  pricingModel: "per_unit",
  unitAmount: 100,         // $0.01/call for overages
  usageMetricId: "api-calls"
}
```

**Example billing:**
```
10 Developer Seats × $50 = $500/month
Included: 100K API calls (10K per seat)

Actual usage: 150K calls
Overage: 50K × $0.01 = $500

Total: $500 (seats) + $500 (overage) = $1,000
```

**When to use:**
- Usage varies significantly per user
- Want predictable base + flexible ceiling
- Avoid bill shock from pure usage pricing
- Common in API platforms, infrastructure

### Strategy 3: Tiered plans with seat limits

Fixed plans with included seat ranges.

```
Starter Plan: $99/month
├── Up to 5 seats included
└── $20 per additional seat

Professional Plan: $299/month
├── Up to 20 seats included
└── $15 per additional seat

Enterprise Plan: Custom pricing
├── Unlimited seats
└── Volume discounts available
```

**When to use:**
- Want simple plan tiers
- Packaging strategy (good-better-best)
- Small teams prefer all-inclusive pricing
- Reduce pricing complexity

## Seat management best practices

### Tracking seat usage

**Automatic sync from your app:**
```typescript
// Add seat
await commet.seats.add({
  customerId: "customer-uuid",
  seatTypeId: "admin-seat-uuid",
  userId: "user-123",
  email: "john@acme.com",
  effectiveDate: new Date()
});

// Remove seat
await commet.seats.remove({
  customerId: "customer-uuid",
  seatId: "seat-uuid",
  effectiveDate: new Date()  // or future date
});

// Get current balance
const balance = await commet.seats.getBalance({
  customerId: "customer-uuid",
  seatTypeId: "admin-seat-uuid"
});
// Returns: { quantity: 20, lastUpdated: "2025-01-15" }
```

### Customer transparency

**Real-time seat dashboards:**
- Show current seat count vs contracted minimum
- Display cost per seat and total monthly cost
- Preview impact of adding/removing seats
- Show proration calculations before confirming

**Seat usage alerts:**
- Notify when approaching contracted minimum
- Alert when adding seats mid-cycle (proration warning)
- Remind before billing cycle for seat optimization

### Governance and controls

**Seat limits:**
```typescript
{
  minimumSeats: 10,        // Contract minimum
  maximumSeats: 100,       // Hard cap (optional)
  currentSeats: 45,        // Actual usage
  allowOverages: true      // Can exceed minimum
}
```


## Troubleshooting seat-based billing

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Seats not appearing on invoice | Seat added after period close | Ensure seats added before billing cycle ends |
| Proration incorrect | Wrong effective date | Verify seat addition date is accurate |
| Billed for removed seats | Seats not removed in system | Audit seat balance vs active users |
| Customer disputes seat count | Mismatch between app and billing | Implement daily seat sync reconciliation |
| Minimum not enforced | Agreement configuration missing | Check agreement has minimumSeats set |
| Overage charges unexpected | Customer unaware of minimums | Display seat limits in customer dashboard |
