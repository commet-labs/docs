## Basic Usage

Track user activity and bill for it. Common use cases:

- **Token usage** - Measure API token consumption
- **Conversation count** - Track chat/message volume  
- **Payment tracking** - Count transaction events

<Callout type="info">
Seats use events too, but are handled differently. See the [Seat Management](/library/features/seat-management) section.
</Callout>

Send a single usage event:

```typescript
const result = await commet.usage.create({
  eventType: 'api_call',
  customerId: 'cus_A1b2C3d4E5f6G7h8I9j0K1l2',
  quantity: 1,
})

console.log('Event tracked:', result.data.id)
```

## Event Types

Create event types in the Commet dashboard first. This makes them available in our SDK for easier integration.
