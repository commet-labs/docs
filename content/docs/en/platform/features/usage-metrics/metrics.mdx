## Define Usage Metric

Create a usage metric that tracks specific customer behavior:

```json
{
  "id": "api-calls-metric-uuid",
  "name": "API Calls",
  "key": "api_calls",
  "aggregationType": "sum",
  "unitLabel": "calls"
}
```

## Aggregation Types

- **Sum** - Total units consumed (API calls, storage GB, compute hours)
- **Max** - Peak concurrent usage (max simultaneous connections, peak compute)
- **Unique** - Distinct count (monthly active users, unique API keys used)
- **Count** - Number of events (transactions, deployments, builds)

## Create Metrics

Click "Create Metric" and configure:

* **Event type** - Which events to track
* **Aggregation type** - How to group them (sum, count, etc.)
* **Metadata filters** - Optional conditions to filter specific events
