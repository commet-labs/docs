description: Track and manage user seats - add, remove, monitor

Seats are special events with unique handling. We manage them separately for better control.

Use the SDK to create, remove, or adjust seat counts. Always know your active user count.

## Seat Types

Create different seat types for roles or pricing tiers (paid vs free).

**Create seat type**: Go to Seats → Types → + Add seat type

## Balance Tracking

Monitor seat evolution over time, both total and per-customer. Useful for growth analysis without custom dashboards.

## Add Seats

Increase seat count for a customer:

```typescript
const result = await commet.seats.add({
  customerId: 'cus_A1b2C3d4E5f6G7h8I9j0K1l2',
  seatType: 'admin',
  quantity: 5
})

console.log(`Added ${result.data.quantity} admin seats`)
```

## Remove Seats

Decrease seat count:

```typescript
const result = await commet.seats.remove({
  customerId: 'cus_A1b2C3d4E5f6G7h8I9j0K1l2',
  seatType: 'admin',
  quantity: 2
})

console.log(`Removed ${result.data.quantity} admin seats`)
```
