## Overview

The finance module handles three core functions:

* **Balance tracking** - Where your money sits
* **Payouts** - Getting money out
* **Transaction history** - What happened when

## Balance States

Your money exists in one of four states:

* **Held** - Money we're holding (usually for compliance/risk reasons)

* **Pending** - Money from transactions that's still processing

* **Available** - Money ready to withdraw

* **Paid Out** - Money already sent to your bank account

Money sitting in Available for 90+ days gets auto-payout to your account.
