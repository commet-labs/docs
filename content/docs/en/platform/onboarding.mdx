<Step>

### 1. Create an Account

Go to https://billing.commet.co. If it's your first time accessing, you'll need to complete some basic information about your company.

</Step>

<Step>

### 2. Create or Import a Customer

As a first step, you'll need to create a customer from the Customer tab. There you'll define their billing information, currency, and conditions.

</Step>

<Step>

### 3. Usage Events and Metrics

If your pricing is based on events or seats, you can use our API to send us events in real time. Then you'll need to create metrics, which are simply ways to group events to later feed the products that your customers will have.

</Step>

<Step>

### 4. Create Your Tax Rates

All Commet products must have a product type and an associated tax rate. This allows us to calculate taxes directly. You'll need to create at least one product category and one tax rate.

<Callout type="info">
Don't worry, you can always mark your customer as exempt to avoid calculating taxes, and they won't appear on the invoice.

</Step>

### 5. Create Your Products

From the Products tab, create your products, whether they're one-time, recurring, fixed, or tied to some metric created previously.

</Step>

<Step>

### 6. Create an Agreement

Create an agreement to establish the terms and conditions for your customer's subscription or purchase.

</Step>

<Step>

### 7. Create an Agreement

Agreements are where all the conditions agreed upon with your customer come together. Each agreement can have different phases and will determine What and How we will charge our customers.

</Step>

<Step>

### 8. Invoice Generation

When the billing date arrives, an invoice will be generated. These invoices will be ready for you to view.
