## Why Commet?

We believe that the next unicorns will be companies of no more than 20 people, obsessed with product and selling globally. That's why we want to help those teams stay focused on product, and not on building their billing, integrating payments, managing subscriptions or dealing with taxes and compliance.

Commet provides:

- **Flexible pricing models**: From simple subscriptions to complex usage-based pricing with tiers, seats and hybrid models
- **Zero manual load on taxes and compliance**: If you're going to sell globally you'll have to pay taxes in more than one place. We do it.
- **Global payments in 5 lines of code**: Integrate your subscription logic in 5 lines of code and start monetizing.
- **Withdraw your money to your bank**: Withdraw the money collected from your customers net of taxes, directly to your local bank.
- **Developer-first**: We believe that devs should be making product, not billing or payments. That's why we created a tool they love to use and can get back to their work.
