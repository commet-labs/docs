# Commet CLI Overview

Commet CLI provides powerful tools to authenticate, manage projects, and generate TypeScript types for your billing platform.

## What is Commet CLI?

The command-line interface (CLI) allows you to interact with the Commet platform directly from your terminal, enabling you to:

- **Authenticate** with Commet using secure OAuth device flow
- **Link projects** to organizations for seamless integration
- **Generate TypeScript types** from your event and seat configurations
- **Manage environments** across sandbox and production
- **Inspect configurations** and project status

<Callout type="info">
**Prerequisites**: You'll need a Commet account. [Sign up for sandbox](https://sandbox.commet.co) or [production](https://billing.commet.co).
</Callout>

## Key Features

### OAuth Authentication

Secure device authorization flow with browser-based authentication:

```bash
commet login
```

Choose between sandbox and production environments, then authenticate in your browser.

### Project Linking

Connect your local project to a Commet organization:

```bash
commet link
```

Select your organization and the CLI creates a `.commet` configuration file.

### Type Generation

Generate TypeScript definitions from your Commet configuration:

```bash
commet pull
```

Creates `.commet.d.ts` with type-safe definitions for your event and seat types.

### Environment Management

Work seamlessly across sandbox and production environments with complete isolation.

## Quick Example

```bash
# Authenticate
commet login

# Link to organization
commet link

# Generate types
commet pull

# Check status
commet whoami
```

- **`.commet`**: Project-specific organization settings

See [Configuration](/docs/library/cli/configuration) for details.
