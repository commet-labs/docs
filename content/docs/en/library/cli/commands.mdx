2. Opens your browser for authentication
3. Stores credentials in `~/.commet/auth.json`

**Example output:**
```
? Select environment to login:
❯ Sandbox (Development)
  Production

✓ Opening browser for authentication...
✓ Successfully authenticated!
  
Environment: sandbox
User: john@example.com
```

<Callout type="info">
**Environment Selection**: Choose Sandbox for development/testing or Production for live billing. Each requires separate authentication.
</Callout>

---

### `commet logout`

Remove stored authentication credentials.

```bash
commet logout
```

**What it does:**
- Deletes `~/.commet/auth.json`
- Requires re-authentication with `commet login`

```bash
commet whoami
```

## Project Management Commands

### `commet link`

Link the current directory to a Commet organization.

```bash

? Select organization:
❯ Acme Corp (acme-corp)
  Beta Inc (beta-inc)

✓ Project linked successfully!

Project configuration:
  Organization: Acme Corp
  Environment: sandbox

Next step:
  Run `commet pull` to generate TypeScript types
```

**Prerequisites:**
- Must be authenticated (`commet login`)
- Must be in a project directory

<Callout type="warn">
**Existing Links**: If the project is already linked, you'll need to run `commet unlink` first.
</Callout>

---

### `commet unlink`

Unlink the current directory from Commet.

```bash
commet unlink
```

**What it does:**
- Removes `.commet` configuration file
- Project remains authenticated but not linked

**Example output:**
```
✓ Project unlinked successfully
```

### `commet switch`

Switch to a different organization.

```bash

```

**What it does:**

- Updates `.commet` with new organization
- Environment remains the same (from auth token)

**Example output:**
```
✓ Fetching organizations...

? Select organization:
  Acme Corp (acme-corp)
❯ Beta Inc (beta-inc)

✓ Switched organization successfully!

New configuration:
  Organization: Beta Inc
  Environment: sandbox

Run `commet pull` to update TypeScript types for this organization
```

<Callout type="info">
**Environment Lock**: Switch only changes organization within the same environment. To switch environments, use `commet logout` then `commet login`.
</Callout>

---

### `commet info`

```bash
commet info
```

**Example output:**
```
Project Information

  - email_sent
  - payment_processed

Seat Types: 2
  - admin
  - user
```

**Use cases:**

## Type Generation Commands

### `commet pull`

Generate TypeScript type definitions from your Commet configuration.

```bash
commet pull [options]
```

**Options:**
- `-o, --output <path>` - Output file path (default: `.commet.d.ts`)

**Examples:**

<Tabs items={['Default', 'Custom Output', 'Subdirectory']}>
<Tab value="Default">
```bash
commet pull
```
Creates `.commet.d.ts` in current directory.
</Tab>
<Tab value="Custom Output">
```bash
commet pull -o types/commet.d.ts
```
Creates `types/commet.d.ts`.
</Tab>
<Tab value="Subdirectory">
```bash
commet pull -o src/types/billing.d.ts
```
Creates `src/types/billing.d.ts`.
</Tab>
</Tabs>

**Generated file example:**
```typescript
// .commet.d.ts
export type CommetEventType = "api_call" | "email_sent" | "payment_processed";
export type CommetSeatType = "admin" | "user" | "viewer";
```

**Use in code:**
```typescript
import type { CommetEventType, CommetSeatType } from './.commet';

// Type-safe events
await commet.usage.events.create<CommetEventType>({
  customerId: 'cus_123',
  eventType: 'api_call', // Autocomplete works!
});

// Type-safe seats
await commet.seats.add<CommetSeatType>('cus_123', 'admin', 5);
```

**Prerequisites:**
- Must be authenticated and linked
- Organization must have event or seat types configured

<Callout type="info">
**Git Integration**: Add `.commet.d.ts` to version control so team members have consistent types.
</Callout>
